# Assignment-1
My project is about creating a website for a band that was famous in the 1960s and is still quite popular now, The Beatles. The website shows fans or anyone who visits the website, a general explaination of The Beatles. It briefly shows them what The Beatles did and who it consisted of. They users are also able to see the numerous history of tour dates that The Beatles have done. The website also helps to promote and sell items such as merch to the users. Users who are unsure of who The Beatles are and what they have done are able to check out a list of their albums and listen to their music.

## Design Process
The website is mainly for users who are new and unaware of the band The Beatles and fans. As a user who is not very familiar with the band, The Beatles, I would want to be able to easily find out who they are on the website. With this in mind, the page for Band gives a brief description of who is in the band in what they did as an artist and in the band. Not only that, The page for the history of tour dates they did in the past gives a general idea of how many concerts they have done. When the users first enter and see the home page, they can also know about what types of music the Beatles does. From the perspective of a fan of The Beatles, they would want to be able to purchase merch such as clothes related to the band so the can also help the band sell items.

## Features

### Existing Features
- In the music page, when the users click the image of one of the popular songs, they would be redirected to a new tab showing the song
- At the end of the home page, users can enter their email address for notifications
- Social media icons at end of page to bring users to their social media accounts

### Features Left to Implement 
- Add to cart function and displaying items in the cart
- The payment checkout function

### Technologies Used
- Google Fonts
    - To change fonts for different sections and headings
- Font Awesome
    - To include in social media icons

### Testing
- Go to end of home page
- Input an Email Address
- It should show that input was successful

On phone screens, the format of most of the pages changes such as the album page, home page. The elements were in a row format but for phones it would be in a column format due to the screen being small. 

#### Bugs/Problems
- The navigation menu at the top has some parts cut off when scrolling instead of being in a fixed position.
- The format of the navigation menu changed a little in the shop page.
- Some background color did not fit the whole screen when in the phone screen
